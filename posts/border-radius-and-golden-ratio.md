# Intro

A few years ago, when I learned `border-radius`, I felt very fulfilled. It could make our html element beautiful. And then I became confused: ‚ÄúHow to organize the size of the border-radius?‚Äù. This question followed me for a long time.

# The method I used to design

Later, I began to learn from the design styles of other websites. At that time, I liked designing a component like this: Set a **15px** border-radius and a **15px** padding for the parent as a container, and then set **10px** border-radius with **10px** for the child as content. If the ratios look not well, adjust it in the DevTools and use the best value...

When our pages became complex, this approach will be cumbersome, sometimes I have to make many modifications to get the desire style.

# Golden Ratio to organize border-radius

I have always wanted a method to establish the size of border-radius for different containers. Someday I realized that I could use a ratio to organize the border-radius between parent and childrens elements. So I tried the [Golden Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio):

1. For a known element has a border-radius _N_
2. Set its children's border-radius with _N _ 0.618\*.
3. You could use _Math.round_ to convert it to an integer, this will look neat.

I think that‚Äôs a useful skill, when you design the border-radius by this way, your component could be beautiful!~
